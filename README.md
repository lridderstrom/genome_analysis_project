Project plan


● What is the aim of your project? What question(s) do you want to answer with your
research?

The aim of the project is to perform a metagenome assembly and find out what bacteria there are in two different environments and their gene expression. 

● What type of analyses will you perform in order to answer these questions? And in
which order? Which softwares will you use? Are there any time bottlenecks? If so,
can you identify any analyses that will require longer times?

- trim data
- Metagenome assembly
- binning
- 

● What is the time frame for your project? Can you define some time checkpoints for
when you should have finished certain analyses? When do you need to have finished
running all the softwares so you can start to analyse the data?

- presentation 28 May

● What types of data will you be handling? How much space do you need in order to
store the data? (You might not know that in advance, but pay attention to this as you
work and manage your available space!)

● How will you organise your data? (see “Project Organization”)
